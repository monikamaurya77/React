2) What all information is stored in package.json and how is it different from package-lock.json?
ANS:- Your package. json holds important information about the project. 
It contains human-readable metadata about the project (like the project name and description) as well as functional metadata 
like the package version number and a list of dependencies required by the application.

Difference between package. json and package-lock. json files are,
package.json -> It contains basic information about the project.
                It is mandatory for every project.
                It records important metadata about the project.
                It contains information such as name, description,author, script, and dependencies.
package.lock.json -> It describes the exact tree that was generated to allow subsequent installs to have the identical tree.
                     It is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either node_modules tree or package.json.
	             It allows future devs to install the same dependencies in the project.
	             It contains the name, dependencies, and locked version of the project.
