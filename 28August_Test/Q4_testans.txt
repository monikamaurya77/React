App. js on the other hand has the root component of the react app because every view and component are handled with hierarchy

Index.js

your main react component onto your “root” element(which you mark in your html).

app.css
in React is used to style the React App or Component. 
The style attribute is the most used attribute for styling in React applications, which adds dynamically-computed styles at render time. 
It accepts a JavaScript object in camelCased properties rather than a CSS string.
