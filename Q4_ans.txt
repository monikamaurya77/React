4) What's the Use of the useMemo() Hook? Explain by giving an example.
ANS:-  The useMemo Hook can be used to keep expensive, resource intensive functions from needlessly running. In this example, we have an expensive function that runs on every render. When changing the count or adding a todo, you will notice a delay in execution.
The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value.
memoization is a concept used in general when we donâ€™t need to recompute the function with a given argument for the next time as it returns the cached result. A memoized function remembers the results of output for a given set of inputs. 

example, if there is a function to add two numbers, and we give the parameter as 1 and 2 for the first time the function will add these two numbers and return 3, but if the same inputs come again then we will return the cached value i.e 3 and not compute with the add function again. In react also, we use this concept, whenever in the React component, the state and props do not change the component and the component does not re-render, it shows the same output.
 The useMemo hook is used to improve performance in our React application.
