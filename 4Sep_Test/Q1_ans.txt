1) What are components in React?
ANS:-   The React application can be broken down into various atomic parts. These atomic parts are called components.
This contains the HTML code along with it's relevant JS functionality and logic.
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.
Components can refer to other components in their output.
A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
