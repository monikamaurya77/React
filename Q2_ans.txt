 2) What are props in React?
ANS:- props stands for properties.
Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.
React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props . 
Props are objects which can be used inside a component.
If you're already familiar with how arguments & functions work in JavaScript, understanding props is a piece of cake! In a nutshell, props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React and they are the main mechanism for component communication.
 Components can be passed as props.
Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.
Props are arguments passed into React components.
The Props only flows from parent to Child Component.
The prop data can be anything, primitive data type, non primitive data type, even functional references.
